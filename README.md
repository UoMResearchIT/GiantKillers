# Notes
* 124 team in the game but only 50 are controllable and divided up by player
* 6 categories of teams (EPL, CH, L1+L2, NL + NLNS, North+South+Isthmian, Others)
* Owners cards have indicative gate value.
* When game seeds, many clubs have byes that let them join at various later stages of the competition.
* The game doesn’t involve the qualifying rounds – they can be seeded automatically, and the game starts with the first-round proper.
* There are different dice to dictate your look depending on what category you are in and whether they are home or away.
* Dice rolls then determine the outcome of the fixture.
* The replay system applies in the event of a draw and the fixture goes to the back of the pack.
* The extra time dice then is rolled once by each team to determine the outcome after extra time.
* The penalty dice has a score, miss, save options.
* Sudden death with penalties.
* Gate money / prize money, TV money etc is something that is tracked per team so you can “win” based on different things.
* There are some additional mechanics:
    * Cup Magic card – if team from lower cat draws high cat opponent. If the lower team loses fixture, they can draw one of 24 cup magic cards. You can draw a cup magic card to boost your goals.
    * If you beat a team from a higher cat you get a giant killer card per category to the team.
    * Two giant killer cards equals one goal. You can choose when to cash them in and they are lost.
* You could build the engine as a bunch of classes and actually have the game run as a console app. If we built it as a Xamarin App, we could just have the UI a simple button and a log stating the outcomes.
* Additional features:
    * Add ability to ensure your favourite teams get through
    * Add ability to add your own teams
    * Multiplayer with net code
